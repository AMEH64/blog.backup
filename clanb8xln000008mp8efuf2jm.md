# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Allen Hansen. I am a UMN alum and a senior full stack software developer with 5+ years of experience developing SaaS solutions. I specialize in using Angular and .NET to build accessible SPAs and resilient REST APIs that perform at scale. Recently, I have been learning how to build cloud native solutions, specifically with Azure.

I am starting a blog with the hopes of creating my own personalized knowledge base and to foster an environment where I can explore new ideas and receive feedback from the community at large.

I recently watched a personal productivity talk [1] by [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com) where he touches on the idea that *"You have a finite number of keystrokes left in your hands before you die."* [1], [2], [3] and that *"Email is where keystrokes go to die."* [1].

According to [keysleft.com](https://keysleft.com), a site created by [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com), I have approximately `232,127,739` keystrokes remaining in my life.

I aim to use my keystrokes wisely and hope that this blog will help me to increase my *"keystrokes potential"* [1].
